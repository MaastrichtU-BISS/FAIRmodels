# FAIRmodels

Welcome to the FAIRmodels website. This is currently just a placeholder for the [index.ttl](index.ttl) file.

## Using the index
To search the indexed models, you can download and run the [FAIR model commissioning station](https://gitlab.com/UM-CDS/projects/FAIRcomml/model-commissioning-station). An example version of this commissioning station is available on [dev-station.fairmodels.org](https://dev-station.fairmodels.org). **Please note that this station is for development/testing/demonstration purposes. Uptime will not be guaranteed.**
