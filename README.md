# FAIRmodels

Welcome to the FAIRmodels website. This FAIRmodels platform has various components, which are explained below.

## Model descriptions
AI/ML model descriptions can be found at [https://describe.fairmodels.org](https://describe.fairmodels.org). This description is based on Model Cards, and extended with several specific fields for search and application of AI models in practice.

## Actual models and interoperability
The actual AI/ML models can be found at [https://models.fairmodels.org](https://model.fairmodels.org). These models are currently in ONNX format, but will be extended in the future. Model descriptions need to be linked to make the actual AI model (more) semantically interoperable.

## Searching FAIRmodels
To search the models, the user interface of the [## Model descriptions](## Model descriptions) needs to be updated. At the moment, please visit [https://graphdb.fairmodels.org](https://graphdb.fairmodels.org) to query the available models.
