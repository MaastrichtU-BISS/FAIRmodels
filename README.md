# FAIRmodels

Welcome to the FAIRmodels website. This is currently just a placeholder for the [index.ttl](index.ttl) file and the main [ontology.owl](ontology.owl) (work-in-progress).

## Using the index
To search the indexed models, you can download and run the [FAIR model browser](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-CDS/Model-Browser). This browser fetches all referenced models from the [index.ttl](index.ttl), and makes these indexed models searcheable.

Based on this index and the model browser, we also developed a suite of services to perform commissioning of machine learning models in clinical practice (the FAIRcomml project). This set of services is available in the [Model Commissioning Workflow](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-CDS/Model-Commissioning-Workflow) repository.
