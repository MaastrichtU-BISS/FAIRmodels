# About FAIRmodels

## 🎓 Background

FAIRmodels is an initiative to make artificial intelligence and machine learning models adhere to the FAIR principles: **Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable**, and **Reusable**. Originally established for data management, these principles are equally important for AI models, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

## 🏛️ Organization

FAIRmodels is developed and maintained by:

### Brightlands Institute for Smart Society (BISS)

The [Brightlands Institute for Smart Society](https://www.biss-institute.com/) at Maastricht University focuses on innovative solutions for healthcare and societal challenges using data science, AI, and smart technologies.

### Clinical Data Science Research Group

Our work is part of the [Clinical Data Science](https://clinicaldatascience.nl/) research group, which specializes in:
- FAIR data principles in healthcare
- Privacy-enhancing technologies
- Federated learning and distributed AI
- Clinical decision support systems
- Personal Health Train paradigm

## 👥 Team

The FAIRmodels platform is developed by researchers, software engineers, and clinicians dedicated to responsible AI in healthcare.
